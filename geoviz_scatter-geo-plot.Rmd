This tutorial demonstrates how to create interactive choropleth like the one below using the leaflet library, there are no alternative libraries currently considered in this guide.

  paste0(
    "<p>", state_name, "</p>",

  )
}
leaflet(data = contiguous_us_shapefiles) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%

    smoothFactor = 0.2,

    fillColor = ~palette(Count.of.locations),
    weight = 1,
    popup = ~region_labeller(State_Name,Count.of.locations)
  ) %>% addLegend(
    position = 'bottomleft',

    labels = c("0","1-5","5-10","10-20","20-50","50-350"),

    title = "Number of Points in State")
```

 It is important to note that such maps are generated from two datasets: points on the map and region shape files, the colours are then assigned according to the number of points in each region.

- Shapefiles for the regions of interest as supported by `readOGR` (see below for further details)
- A .csv file contain a set of geographic points with decimal formatted longitude and latitude coordinates

```{r}
example <- structure(list(longitude = c(-104.990251, -104.990251, 13.960129, 
13.960129, 13.960129), latitude = c(39.739236, 39.739236, 50.97178, 
50.97178, 50.97178)), .Names = c("longitude", "latitude"), row.names = c(NA, 
5L), class = "data.frame")
## kable is loaded from the knitr library to convert the data.frame into a Markdown table for display purposes

```


# Importing Shapefiles

Shapefiles will be imported with the `readOGR` function and the stored as a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` - this workflow requires what we might term ESRI or DBF formatted shapefiles. An informative wikipedia page on this format is available <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">here</a>, the first check for whether your shapefiles are correctly formatted is whether you have a directory containing the following files:

- shapefile_name.dbf
- shapefile_name.shx
- shapefile_name.shp
- shapefile_name.prj (if this file is not provided additional work is required to discover the projection of the shapefiles)

In this example the US state boundaries as provided by [https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html) are used. This is primarily because the US government provides an excellent repository for correctly formatted shapefiles and the US states are large regions that are easy to compare, unlike the UK administrative borders.

The shapefiles are imported using `readOGR` from the `rgdal` library; specifying the directory containing the shape files to `dsn` and the `shapefile_name` to `layer` (note the use of `verbose = F` to prevent uninteresting messages from the function). Details of the `leaflet` library are covered later, but for demonstrative purposes it is useful to see the US state boundaries are clearly visible:

```{r}
library(rgdal)
full_us_shapefiles <- readOGR(dsn = "data/shapefiles", layer = "cb_2015_us_state_500k", verbose = F)
library(leaflet)
leaflet(data = full_us_shapefiles) %>% addTiles() %>% 
  addPolygons(
  weight = 1
)
```

Unfortunately, the shapefiles include all US terrorities. Often it is only the contiguous United States that are displayed in visualisations, and this does make a very useful example for this guide. Fortunately, it is fairly easy to extract this set of states through the use of the US FIPS Codes which are documented <a href='https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/codes/cou.html'>here</a> and this data is stored in the `full_us_shapefiles` object but need to be converted to numeric format for use later:

```{r}
full_us_shapefiles$STATEFP <- as.numeric(as.character(full_us_shapefiles$STATEFP))
full_us_shapefiles$STATEFP
```

The function `make_us_contiguous` uses the `US-FIPS-Codes.csv` file hosted on <a href='https://figshare.com/articles/Assorted_Shapefiles_and_Associated_Data_for_Geographic_Visualisations/3505169'>Figshare</a> to extract only those polgyons in `full_us_shapefiles` that are in the contiguous USA:


```{r}
fips_codes <- read.csv("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5548022", stringsAsFactors = F)
make_us_contiguous <- function(spatial_polgyon= NA){
  contiguous_fips_codes <- fips_codes[fips_codes$Contiguous.United.States. == "Y",]$STATE
  contiguous <- full_us_shapefiles[spatial_polgyon$STATEFP %in% contiguous_fips_codes,]
  # Drop unnecessary levels
  contiguous@data <- droplevels(contiguous@data)
  contiguous
}
contiguous_us_shapefiles <- make_us_contiguous(full_us_shapefiles)
```

The `fips_codes` object also contains the names of the states, which may be added to the `contiguous_us_shapefiles` object and can be visualised with `leaflet` once more. Note that the function `mapvalues` from the `plyr` library is used as it is massively convenient for modifying a vector according to a set of key-value pairs.

```{r}
library(plyr)
contiguous_fips_codes <- fips_codes[fips_codes$Contiguous.United.States. == "Y",]
contiguous_us_shapefiles$State_Name <- mapvalues(contiguous_us_shapefiles$STATEFP, 
                                                 from = contiguous_fips_codes$STATE, 
                                                 to = contiguous_fips_codes$STATE_NAME)
leaflet(data = contiguous_us_shapefiles) %>% addTiles() %>% 
  addPolygons(
  weight = 1
)
```

# Count Points Per Location

In order to count the number of points within each state it is necessary to create a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`, in the code below the `lat-long-points.csv` file is first imported and then converted into such an object. It is necessary to specify the projection for the `SpatialPointsDataFrame`, which is simply extracted from the `contiguous_us_shapefiles` object.

```{r}
locations_df <- read.csv("data/lat-long-points.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
locations_spdf <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords = locations_df,
                                         data = locations_df,
                                         proj4string = contiguous_us_shapefiles@proj4string)
```

The `GISTools` library includes `poly.counts` which provides a simple way to count the number of points within each region and this data can easily be added to `contiguous_us_shapefiles` in the same manner as the State names:

```{r}
contiguous_counts <- poly.counts(pts = locations_spdf, polys = contiguous_us_shapefiles)
contiguous_us_shapefiles$Count.of.locations <- as.numeric(contiguous_counts)
```

# Basic Leaflet Map of Shapefiles

Leaflet maps are created in layers and very much favour the pipe "`%`" operator, the most basic map of the world can be constructed in one of two ways:

```{r}
base_map <- leaflet()
addTiles(base_map)
## or
leaflet() %>% addTiles()
```

The shapefiles are added to the map using `addPolygons`, in the code below a number of optional arguments have been supplied to customise the appearance of the borders.

```{r}
leaflet(data = contiguous_us_shapefiles) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addPolygons(
  stroke = TRUE,
  color = "#000000",
  smoothFactor = 0.2,
  weight = 1
)
```

Before creating a colour palette for the map, thereby makign it a choropleth, it is useful to note how popups can be added to the map. In the map below the `State_Name` will be shown when a state is clicked, the tilda (`~`) allows the namespace of the `contiguous_us_shapefiles` object to be accessed.

```{r}
leaflet(data = contiguous_us_shapefiles) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addPolygons(
  stroke = TRUE,
  color = "#000000",
  smoothFactor = 0.2,
  weight = 1,
  popup = ~State_Name
)
```

# Custom Choropleth Color Palette

The RColorBrewer library provides a number of versatile and accessible color palettes, see colorbrewer2.org for a breakdown of these, we can use in the choropleth via `brewer.pal`. In the code below a six colour palette is defined over the range 0 - 350 with `colorBin`, note the use of `alpha` to ensure that coloured regions are opaque to the map details behind them.

```{r}
palette <- colorBin(c("#cccccc",brewer.pal(5, "YlGnBu")), 
                    bins = c(0,1,5,10,20,50,350),
                    alpha = TRUE
                    )
```

This fill colour of the polygons can now be specified with `palette(Count.of.locations)`:

```{r}
leaflet(data = contiguous_us_shapefiles) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addPolygons(
  stroke = TRUE,
  color = "#000000",
  smoothFactor = 0.2,
  fillOpacity = 0.6,
  fillColor = ~palette(Count.of.locations),
  weight = 1,
  popup = ~State_Name
)
```

The popup displayed at the moment in the map contains only the state name, the following utility function allows the state name and the number of data points in the location to be displayed: 

```{r}
region_labeller <- function(state_name = NA, number_of_points = NA){
  paste0(
    "<p>State: ", state_name, "</p>",
    "<p>Number of Points: ", number_of_points, "</p>"
  )
}
choropleth_map <- leaflet(data = contiguous_us_shapefiles) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addPolygons(
  stroke = TRUE,
  color = "#000000",
  smoothFactor = 0.2,
  fillOpacity = 0.6,
  fillColor = ~palette(Count.of.locations),
  weight = 1,
  popup = ~region_labeller(State_Name,Count.of.locations)
)
choropleth_map
```

# Choropleth Legend

The `leaflet` library provides a very flexible legend, which can be provided with our custom colour scheme as follows:

```{r}
choropleth_map %>% addLegend(
  position = 'bottomleft',
  colors = c("#cccccc",brewer.pal(5, "YlGnBu")),
  labels = c("0","1-5","5-10","10-20","20-50","50-350"),
  opacity = 0.6,
  title = "Number of Points in State")   ## title of the legend
```
